======================

Requirements
- This application has the same requirements as the previous project, except that now you'll be logging your daily coding time.
- To show the data on the console, you should use the "Spectre.Console" library.
- You're required to have separate classes in different files (ex. UserInput.cs, Validation.cs, CodingController.cs)
- You should tell the user the specific format you want the date and time to be logged and not allow any other format.
- You'll need to create a configuration file that you'll contain your database path and connection strings.
- You'll need to create a "CodingSession" class in a separate file. It will contain the properties of your coding session: Id, StartTime, EndTime, Duration
- The user shouldn't input the duration of the session. It should be calculated based on the Start and End times, in a separate "CalculateDuration" method.
- The user should be able to input the start and end times manually.
- You need to use Dapper ORM for the data access instead of ADO.NET. (This requirement was included in Feb/2024)
- When reading from the database, you can't use an anonymous object, you have to read your table into a List of Coding Sessions.
- Follow the DRY Principle, and avoid code repetition.

Tips
- It's up to you the order in which you'll build, but we recommend you do it in this order: configuration file, model, database/table creation, CRUD controller (where the operations will happen), TableVisualisationEngine (where the consoleTableExt code will be run) and finally: validation of data.
- Sqlite doesn't support dates. We recommend you store the datetime as a string in the database and then parse it using C#. You'll need to parse it to calculate the duration of your sessions.
- Don't forget to push your changes to github every time you stop working.
- Don't forget the user input's validation: Check for incorrect dates. What happens if a menu option is chosen that's not available? What happens if the users input a string instead of a number? Remember that the end date can't be before the start date.

Challenges
- Add the possibility of tracking the coding time via a stopwatch so the user can track the session as it happens.
- Let the users filter their coding records per period (weeks, days, years) and/or order ascending or descending.
- Create reports where the users can see their total and average coding session per period.
- Create the ability to set coding goals and show how far the users are from reaching their goal, along with how many hours a day they would have to code to reach their goal. You can do it via SQL queries or with C#.
